üç≥ Food Recipes App

This iOS application fetches food recipes from TheMealDB API and allows users to view, favorite, and explore detailed cooking instructions. The project is structured using Clean Architecture, incorporates Dependency Injection, and leverages Reactive Programming with SwiftUI and Combine.

üè¢ Architecture Overview: Clean Architecture

The project separates concerns into three main layers:

1. Presentation Layer

Displays the UI and handles user interaction.

Files:

RecipesView.swift ‚Äî List and navigation UI

MealDetailView.swift, RecipeDetailView.swift ‚Äî Recipe detail UI

ProfileView.swift ‚Äî User profile info

MealViewModel.swift, RecipeViewModel.swift ‚Äî State management and logic

2. Domain Layer

Core business logic and entities.

Files:

Meal.swift, Recipe.swift

3. Data Layer

API communication and persistence.

Files:

MealRepository.swift, MealRepositoryImpl.swift

MealsResponse.swift

FavoriteMeal.swift (SwiftData model)

‚öôÔ∏è Dependency Injection

What it does:

Makes components modular and testable by injecting dependencies like repositories.

Where it's used:

// RecipesView.swift
init(repository: MealRepository) {
    _viewModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: RecipeViewModel(repository: repository))
}

// MealViewModel.swift
init(repository: MealRepository) {
    self.repository = repository
    fetchMeals()
}

‚öõÔ∏è Reactive Programming

What it does:

Uses Combine and SwiftUI to update UI automatically when data changes.

Where it's used:

// MealViewModel.swift
@Published var meals: [Meal] = []
@Published var favorites: [FavoriteMeal] = []

repository.fetchMeals()
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { _ in }, receiveValue: { [weak self] meals in
        self?.meals = meals
    })
    .store(in: &cancellables)

RecipesView.swift reacts to @Published values using SwiftUI's data binding system.

üîÑ SwiftData Integration

What it does:

Stores user favorites persistently using SwiftData.

Where it's used:

// MealViewModel.swift
func toggleFavorite(meal: Meal) {
    if let existing = favorites.first(where: { $0.id == meal.id }) {
        context.delete(existing)
    } else {
        let favorite = FavoriteMeal(id: meal.id, name: meal.name, thumbnail: meal.thumbnail)
        context.insert(favorite)
    }
    try? context.save()
    loadFavorites()
}
